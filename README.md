# L-Manager

The L-Manager will be a sound library manager, created to improve the workflow of sound designers. The most basic functionalities to be attained are:

- Correctly classify all the sound files in a given directory (sound library)
- Create subfolders for each sound class and move the classified sound files to their respective class folder

The entire data was obtained from the FSD50K Dataset, although other approaches will be tested aswell such as working directly with the Audioset dataset.

The L-Manager is the first of a set of audio tools that I'm creating with the purpose of improving the workflow of content creators. It is also my starting point as a developer in this field, and so, it is the perfect opportunity for me to put in practice some of the concepts that I have and still am studying.
